# Aquarium

Aquarium is a simple object-oriented programming (OOP) Java project developed during the second year of a bachelor's degree. The project focuses on utilizing various design patterns and multi-threading concepts to create a program window that simulates an aquarium. Each fish within the aquarium is represented as a separate thread, providing a dynamic and interactive environment for the user.

## Features

* Aquarium Simulation: Experience a virtual aquarium environment within the program window.
* Multi-Threaded Fish: Each fish in the aquarium is implemented as a separate thread, allowing for concurrent behavior.
* Dynamic Fish Population: Add fishes of different sizes and colors to the aquarium, enhancing the visual diversity of the environment.
* Feeding Functionality: Feed the fishes within the aquarium to maintain their health and vitality.
* Fish Information: Obtain detailed information about each fish, including its size, color, feeding habits, and hunger status.

## Technologies Used

* Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the project.
* Object-Oriented Programming: Leveraged OOP principles to design and structure the aquarium simulation.
* Design Patterns: Utilized various design patterns to enhance code modularity and maintainability.
* Multi-Threading: Implemented multi-threading to simulate concurrent fish behavior within the aquarium.

## Getting Started
To run the Aquarium program locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```java
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aquarium.git
cd aquarium
```
3. Compile the Java source files

```java
javac *.java
```
4. Run the main application:
```java
java AquariumMain
```
## Usage
* Upon launching the Aquarium program, you will be presented with a program window simulating an aquarium environment.
* Use the provided options to interact with the aquarium, including adding fishes, feeding them, and accessing information about individual fishes.
* Enjoy observing the dynamic behavior of the fishes swimming concurrently within the aquarium.
